attacks:
    - name: Debt Collector (+2 revolver)
      atk/dmg: +10, 1d10+5 piercing
      ammo:
          - normal: 59
          - silver: 49 (+1 ammo, +1d4 radiant)
      ranged: range 60/240, reload 6, misfire 1
      effect: on a hit, target loses an amount of coins such that their "dollar" value is equal to the damage of the hit. The gun "makes change" in their pockets if necessary. The lost coins are transferred to your coin pouch (or equivalent). If the target has no material wealth (money, gems, etc), the gun deals an additional 3d10 force damage, and if the creature dies as a result, you receive a fragment of their soul (???)

    - james's dual holsters - spending an hour bonding a firearm to the holster will allow a duplicate firearm to appear in the other holster. Dual wielding said firearms allows for the wearer to make an extra attack if they do not have extra attack. the second firearm made with the holster has the same qualities as the bonded weapon
