    ranged: range 60/240, reload 6, misfire 1
    effect: on a hit, target loses an amount of coins such that their "dollar" 
      value is equal to the damage of the hit. The gun "makes change" in their 
      pockets if necessary. The lost coins are transferred to your coin pouch 
      (or equivalent). If the target has no material wealth (money, gems, etc), 
      the gun deals an additional 3d10 force damage, and if the creature dies as
      a result, you receive a fragment of their soul (???)
